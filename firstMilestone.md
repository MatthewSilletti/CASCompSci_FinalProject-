1. Current goal is to have a working game with minimal to no bugs and two working gamemodes

2.  So far I have created the UI for both of the game modes and the main menu, with an idea on how i want the game to work but not necesarrily an idea how to do it

3. There are no bugs in the current version of the game, however once you click into a game mode you have to close and restart the app to get back to the main menus. also i have not tested it on the simulator but it should function.

4. Seeing as I have spent somewhere around 5-7 hours so far on this project and the hardest part is coming up, i would estimate anywhere from 6-9 hours remaining. This puts me somewhere around 40% complete.

5. My biggest acheivement is that I am very very pleased with how it looks and how the menus flow between one another seamlessly.

6. I belibe the hardest part will be implementing the timing feature into the game and having it regocnize wehn the game should end.
