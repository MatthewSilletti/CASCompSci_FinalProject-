# Second Milestone

  ## What was the original goal of your project?

  The original goal was to create a game that times your reaction to clicking a button.

  ## How have the goals of your project changed?

  The main goal of my projected has changed from just having one game mode to having two. Now the game has two different game modes that each have the goal of testing reaction time but in different ways, one has one box and the other tests how fast you can click 9 boxes.

  ## What is a significant thing that you learned while building this project?

  One thing i plan to learn once i understand how to implement it is how to access the global time and convert it into readable time in seconds/milliseconds. This will be the thing i learned after i learn it.

  ## Describe an unexpected challenge that came up during this project, and how you overcame it.

  The unexpected problem I found when making my project was the random generation of different squares that would have popped up to click to test time. The original plan for the game was to have random squares appear to click and that would test your tiem. this however was something i couldnt figure out how to do so i decided on changing my goal for the project.

  ## Knowing what you know now, if you were to rebuild this project completely from scratch, what would you do differently, and why?

  I think that I really like what my project is going to turn out to be. I think that if i were to start it over from the beginning i wouldnt change anything at all. If anything it would be my original idea woudl change to the idea i have now.
